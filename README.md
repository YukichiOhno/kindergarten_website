# Purpose
A fullstack project involving the creation of a kindergarten's database, accompanied by an api to ensure communication between the database and an admin managing the website.

# Sign in
An admin must enter the right credential; otherwise, they won't be able to use the website

# Homepage
A simple homepage that has links to the 4 other pages that manages data involving the entire building

# Facilities and Classes
An admin can add, update, or delete these entities. Below, they can also see the records of each entities.

# Teachers and Children
Same functionality as Facilities and Classes; however, there's more restriction on which data can be entered. A teacher can only oversee a classroom with no more than 10 students, despite class room capacity exceeding past this amount. For example, if the classroom capacity is 25, and there's only 2 teachers assigned to that classroom, only up to 20 students are allowed in that classroom.
